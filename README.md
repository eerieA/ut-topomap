# Topographical Map Shader

... in Unity. Following the tutorial by Alan Zucconi [here](https://www.alanzucconi.com/2022/04/19/topographical-maps/), with a few minor tweaks for personal taste.

## Tweaks

- Used a continous (sort of) ramp texture and calculated the banding.
- Added a band number slider.
